## Explanation: How Visibility Timeout and DLQ are important 

When a message is picked up from the SQS queue by the Lambda function, it becomes temporarily hidden using "visibility timeout". This prevents duplicate processing.

If Lambda fails, the message becomes visible again and can be retried.

I also configured a DLQ (Dead-Letter Queue) to catch any message that failed 3 times. 

This helped me test error-handling and debug issues safely.

DLQ gave me visibility into failed messages instead of silently losing them.

Both features made my system more reliable and easier to troubleshoot during testing.
